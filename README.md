# Deepfake Detection Using Deep Learning Project


The creation and use of deepfakes are becoming more common due to more powerful models and computers. The study and detection of this synthetic generated media are becoming increasingly important. This project aims to study and evaluate the use of Deep Learning for the detection of deepfakes. Deepfake today use state of the art generators such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAE). The project uses a range of architecture in computer vision such AlexNet and ResNets for the detection algorithms combined with other approaches such as the use of Recurrent Neural networks and the use of Face-Extraction in videos. The project attempts a new approach to video deepfake classifier using one single frame. Some methods presented in this work are capable of achieving accuracy as high as 90%.

There is a total of four python scripts (one for each technique) and the datasets used in the project were Celeb-DF and Flickr-Faces-HQ Dataset (FFHQ).
